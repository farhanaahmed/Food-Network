                <h3>Ribbony Shrimp and Pasta Scampi</h3>
                <p>Medium-size shrimp are the perfect size for a twirl of spaghetti shot through with ribbons of squash.
                    Have vegetarians at the table? Omit the shrimp, double the tomatoes and serve with a spoonful of
                    part-skim ricotta cheese on top.</p>

                <h3>Citrusy Vegan
                    Nutritious Fruit Salad</h3>
                <p>The secret to this salad is marinating the tomatoes in a splash of olive oil & sherry vinegar. They
                    become rich & tangy – the perfect contrast for fresh lettuce and cabbage. Also the avocados bring
                    sweet and nutty flavour which is served with special sauce.</p>

                <h3>Savoury Tuscan Vegetable Soup</h3>
                <p>Make a big batch of Ellie's comforting, veggie-packed soup and eat well all week long. It only takes
                    35 minutes to cook up, and clocks in at just 145 calories and 4 grams of fat per serving.Serve
                    topped with Parmesan, if desired.</p>
